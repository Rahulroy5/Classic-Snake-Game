# 🐍 Classic Snake Game  

A classical **Snake Game** implemented in Python as part of the *100 Days of Code* course project. The game is built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and the **Turtle library**, ensuring clean structure, modular design, and smooth gameplay mechanics.  

## 🎮 Features  
- Interactive snake movement with real-time keyboard controls  
- Food generation and score tracking system  
- Snake growth and increasing difficulty with each score  
- Collision detection for walls and self-hits  
- Clean **OOP-based design** for maintainability and extensibility  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `main.py` → Game entry point  
- `snake.py` → Snake class and movement logic  
- `food.py` → Food generation logic  
- `scoreboard.py` → Scoreboard handling and display  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Turtle Library** for graphics and game design  
- **OOP Concepts** for modular architecture
